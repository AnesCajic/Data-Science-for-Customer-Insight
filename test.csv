13642,@AmericanAir I certainly hope my LA /PBI on 25 th has a NEW plane . The seats on Feb 11 th flight ( in reverse) God awful
13643,@AmericanAir 20 HS students from Ithaca NY stuck in Miami flts xld u won't rebook to get kids home use carrier alliance #rulesshouldbend
13644,@AmericanAir Hands down the worst airline to travel with. Really really fucking bad.
13645,@AmericanAir can you use the aa credit platinum select world mastercard for Alaska flights?  Or just american?
13646,@AmericanAir Why did  AA973 return to JFK? Thanks :)
13647,@AmericanAir is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.
13648,@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
13649,@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.
13650,"@AmericanAir yes we did make it home. But by no means am I happy. I've always chosen AA as my 1st choice when flying, I'm rethinking that..."
13651,@AmericanAir still waiting on a dm response..... #sloooowresponses
13652,@AmericanAir @robinreda that can be a stop over before Paris. You are an embarrassment
13653,@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe
13654,@AmericanAir highly disappointed in the baggage service with this merge with @USAirways you guys have lost our 1st bag and now missing items
13655,@AmericanAir just landed - 3hours Late Flight - and now we need to wait TWENTY MORE MINUTES for a gate!  I have patience but none for incompetence.
13656,@AmericanAir FINALLY called me back... BUT HASN'T SPOKEN TO ME.  Like the worst prank call EVER!!
13657,"@AmericanAir wait times of 2 hours to talk with an exec plt agent, what is going on!!!"
13658,@AmericanAir so the one time we upgrade to first class our luggage was open and now missing valuable items that can't be replaced. #upset
13659,"@AmericanAir please rebook me from Seattle to Columbus Tue 2/24, locator: KARAAX, name: Mitchell M Neuer"
13660,"@AmericanAir still no reply to my email sent on 11th February. Even sent an email asking for acknowledgment that's it been recieved, nothing"

13663,@AmericanAir it doesn't allow me to hold. That's the problem.
13664,@AmericanAir has to be the worst airline in the world #yousuck #horrible #Oscars2015
13665,@AmericanAir Reebooked for tomorrow in AA 1389 LV-DFW at 810 am arriving 12.50pm; still open this flight?
13666,".@AmericanAir @USAirways Add insult to injury you guys ""misplaced"" my bag. 

Can't believe you have to pay money to be treated this poorly."

13674,"@AmericanAir I'm beyond confused here. why would you offer an earlier flight?? when they Cancelled Flightled 2222, I asked for TUES. please fix!"
13675,@AmericanAir I'm in MEX.  I need to fly to New York City tomorrow. My new flight on Tuesday is unacceptable. Please help.

13677,@AmericanAir I'm trying to reach the advantage department to add my number to a recent flight

13682,@AmericanAir 235.  We made it to Seattle...
13683,@AmericanAir we will not be flying with you or US air again. The changes and Cancelled Flightations leading up to today's big finale is unacceptable.
13684,@AmericanAir thanks for your apology but it's a bit Late Flight. Cancelled Flighting a flight more than 24 hrs in advance due to weather is ridiculous. We
13685,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight tomorrow (without telling me) and I want to rebook-please help me book a new flight! What # can I call?
13686,@AmericanAir The word failure means: an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success nonperformance of something due.
13687,@AmericanAir Why offer automated call back option when agent is available only to call me &amp; have me sit on hold? At 12:30am. #onholdfordays
13688,@AmericanAir do you have the phone number of a supervisor i can speak to regarding my travels today
13689,@AmericanAir - Hanging up on customers with no chance for a callback is a failure of customer service. 1:30am EST and no one can answer? 2/2
13690,"@AmericanAir To think that I'm a ""Priority Member""! Wonder how you treat the plebes. I know which rewards card I'm Cancelled Flightling immediately."
13691,"@AmericanAir - for the past 5.5 hours, call volume is so high that no one can take my call to Cancelled Flight my itinerary? #YoureDoingItWrong 1/2"
13692,"@AmericanAir Worst airline. You Cancelled Flight flight, don't let me know, I wait on hold 30 mins, told to enter callback for middle of the night?!!"
13693,@AmericanAir  Did you guys just give up helping people? Your phone tree just hangs up on me and I have a flight tomorrow. Connection pending
13694,@AmericanAir you called back just to put me on hold. It's midnight. Literally just want to know how I'm getting home and I'm getting no help
13695,@AmericanAir Flight #2390 delayed 14 hours!! No one at #AmericanAirlines counter can tell my husband that he will be on that flight! Help???
13696,@AmericanAir this has happens so many times. It's just upsetting to see how poorly an airline treats their customers
13697,"@AmericanAir seriously, there aren't any reps available to take phone calls? Even for platinum?"
13698,@AmericanAir overall lack of attention or foresight when managing flights.
13699,@AmericanAir now we are all stuck on the plane after landing because crew unable to figure it out
13700,"@AmericanAir Also, been on hold for 30 minutes with your ""customer service"" to find out when my new flight is scheduled bc your site SUCKS"
13701,@AmericanAir Yes and without my bags. 2 first class tickets to Tahiti would be nice. Just saying

13706,@AmericanAir Your agent sent our family on 3 diff planes to dfw that were as Late Flight due to delay as the Cancelled Flighted plane that started this #fail
13707,"@AmericanAir Finally got a call from AA, but it was an automated voice that hung up on me! I called back &amp; it says it'll be 2 more hours."
13708,@AmericanAir I've been on hold ANOTHER hour and still nothing. My Cancelled Flighted flight was supposed to be six hours from now. #Stranded
13709,@AmericanAir wasn't offered a flight out of PHL until TUESDAY so had to ask to be booked to Houston instead of Austin.
13710,"@AmericanAir will do. I'd think, though, that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?"
13711,"@AmericanAir I am running out of battery you have my chargers,clothes,coat,contact lenses, need to be in mtg tom need help #pathetic service"
13712,@AmericanAir Flight 4606 from MEM to DCA delayed 6 hours! Now holding breath while they keep me trapped 3 hours to de-ice. #scareair

13714,"@AmericanAir bag turned up, no thanks to your useless call-centre and useless website"
13715,"@AmericanAir flight from PHL to Austin Cancelled Flighted, headed to Houston, delayed, now have to pay to rent a car and drive 3 hrs to Austin"
13716,"@AmericanAir I understand the weather issues. I don't understand how I was not notified of the Cancelled Flightlation, and had to realize it so Late Flight."

13719,"@AmericanAir would like to talk to someone, please follow."
13720,@AmericanAir  you have now lost my luggage for40 hours holding for4 hrs on phone #wtf is this how you treat your loyal passengers?#stranded
13721,@AmericanAir @Nashinmypants lmao this is so funny
13722,@AmericanAir have been waiting over THREE hours to talk to someone to rebook a flight due to weather. does call back service actually work??
13723,@AmericanAir the service received by both of us was rude and well below my expectations of your airline. That is what's most frustrating
13724,@AmericanAir I was on a flight for tomorrow and my reservation is coming up.  Help me!
13725,@AmericanAir please DM me a way to get in touch with someone that can help. I'm platinum AA and considering quitting AA BC of this.
13726,@AmericanAir thanks for following up. I think it's fair to refund the ticket price and the two one way rental cars I had to buy.
13727,@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250
13728,@AmericanAir Understood. Thanks anyway
13729,@AmericanAir so what are you going to do for me since I can't take the option you gave me. What type of refund will you do for me?
13730,@AmericanAir 1) I was on 1610 today to YYZ. I had a bit of a bag issue that was cleared up beautifully. Thank you to all of the check in
13731,@AmericanAir sounding like they just got bitch-slapped by @juliasinton948
13732,@AmericanAir when will tomorrow's flight Cancelled Flightlations at Dfw for AA flights be posted? We are on 2424 at 7am from LAX!
13733,@AmericanAir gate agent Jan L at Phoenix was at least able to get my younger daughter seated near my wife. Thank you!
13734,@AmericanAir I've been on hold with international award reservations for almost 2 hours. 800-433-7300 keeps calling me. what is going on?
13735,@AmericanAir can someone actually either call back or help me figure out how I'm getting home??!
13736,@AmericanAir you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
13737,@AmericanAir can I get home before 12 or no?
13738,@AmericanAir I left something on my flight from ORD to SFO earlier today and believe it's on the plane back at ORD now. Please help.

13741,@AmericanAir all good! I'm catching the 11:10p flight tonight. Thanks for the response.
13742,"@AmericanAir that's interesting-Agent told me so. Sadly, another booked passenger didn't make it to gate by push back so I made it on."
13743,"@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, website refers to 1-800#, the 1-800# hangs up on me. Not auto-rebooked. Really? Horrible company."
13744,@AmericanAir booked AA3370 departing JFK 2/25/15. It was booked via BA and I want to change my FF# to AA can you do that for me via Twitter?
13745,@AmericanAir We have been sitting on this bird #AA1457 for 2 hrs on the dfw tarmac.  Some water would be nice.  Where's your manners?

13748,"@AmericanAir Thanks, she did her best. Staying the night in Dallas, new trial to Detroit via Atlanta tomorrow, assuming no Cancelled Flightlations."
13749,@AmericanAir your customer service is a disgrace.
13750,@AmericanAir Joanna did a WONDERFUL job!  Thank her for me?
13751,@AmericanAir She got to the gate just in time to watch the plane push back. 5 minutes was all she needed. Glad we’ve relatives nearby.

13755,@AmericanAir Thanks! Are they really open 3.30 am - 7 pm every day? Any way to check they are open before going all the way there? Thanks.
13756,@AmericanAir Toby hates you lol
13757,@AmericanAir Thanx for replying. DM sent
13758,@AmericanAir what I am put off by is the fact that no gate supervisor has tried to come by and communicate with us.

13760,"@AmericanAir Need to change flight, but the CS # is telling me it can't take my call. Can't change online. Please help. Flight is this week."

13765,"@AmericanAir I have ""continued contacting"" your phone reps for 7 hours and am still unable to get through. That's absurd and I am livid."
13766,@AmericanAir thanks
13767,@AmericanAir probably had money on @BensonHenderson they said to hell with @Cowboycerrone lol
13768,@AmericanAir DFW GATE 16 to BMI agent seriously is beyond incompetent.  Never flying AA again if can be avoided #fail #pathetic

13776,@AmericanAir I'm still on hold if you're wondering...  4 hours 37 minutes and counting.  #ServiceFail #OnHoldForever #Suboptimal
13777,@AmericanAir I have never seen such incompetency from a gate agent in years of business travel DFW B16 gate agent needs training or new job
13778,@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 it says changes can't be made online
13779,@AmericanAir what's the status of flights for Tuesday out of Dallas??
13780,"@AmericanAir Hey you Cancelled Flightled my flight, and I can't get someone on the phone to rebook (2 hour wait minimum). Can I get some service?"
13781,"@AmericanAir our ft 1261 TUS/DFW (w/cx to LGA) tomorrow Cancelled Flighted,  4 hrs so far waiting for call back. What should we do? Need to get to nyc"
13782,"@AmericanAir @USAirways and our meals are also on us, because this company does not care about their #customers. Truly disgraceful."
13783,@AmericanAir by far the best example of the worst company @Cowboycerrone
13784,"@AmericanAir @USAirways cost me a day of vacation ($350 hotel stay), day of dog boarding, and a day of airport parking."
13785,@AmericanAir Got my bags this morning! Thanks!

13790,@AmericanAir ok no worries. Thanks for the straight story. It's appreciated.

13792,@AmericanAir to my destination. After waiting 2 hours and missing our second flight with them. Our #luggage made the flight though...
13793,@AmericanAir flights out of Dallas on Tuesday are not going to be Cancelled Flightled correct?
13794,@AmericanAir that luggage you forgot...#mia.....he just won an oscar😄💝💝💝

13864,@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!
13865,@AmericanAir not yet. I'm next in the terminal a customer service area.
13866,"@AmericanAir and it gets better...other passengers rebooked direct on other airlines. #whereisthelove 
#whybeAAFF?"
13867,"@AmericanAir I need to speak to a REAL PERSON. My flight was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation, and I've been on hold for more than 3 hours."
13868,@AmericanAir you have let me down. Seriously. #unhappycustomer
13869,@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? Does anyone have any business sense at AA?
13870,@AmericanAir why do I have to wait for 2 hours to talk to someone when you changed my flight?
13871,@AmericanAir due to gate agents I missed my connecting flight to Mexico City...not a happy customer AA- let's correct this
13872,@AmericanAir she doesn't have Twitter.
13873,@AmericanAir at some point u need to tell passengers what is going on. At Jfk waiting to get on flight it is a mess.
13874,"@AmericanAir its not that, it's the rude agent who wouldn't listen to anything I would say and it clearly fit into the sizer"
13875,"@AmericanAir seriously, I do not want to wait 24 hours for a flight when I have to prepare for a family funeral."
13876,"@AmericanAir your gate agents at DFW gate B16 are pathetic tonight.  Terrible communication, stories changing and apathetic"
13877,@AmericanAir I was worried when my bag went SAN to DCA 24 hours before me. But our reunion was an organized  breeze! http://t.co/uOARyQ98PU
13878,"@AmericanAir yea no worries. I'm just going home to Denver. Not your fault, weather sucks bad."
13879,@AmericanAir I've been tryin to use my voucher to book a flight the last 2days. Lines are busy. Plse help me?The flight may go up.
13880,"@AmericanAir Yes, thanks for checking. Very cramped, but got on &amp; made it safely. Flying back tomorrow at 1pm. http://t.co/CSddCCMvbD"
13881,@AmericanAir  is the worst airline to ever travel with!!!! The worst!! They're equivalent to DIRT!!!!!!
13882,@AmericanAir great flight experience again... SFO-JFK... Dare I say it? A consistent high quality on a legacy airline? Keep it up guys!
13883,@AmericanAir pretty bad at #DFW no updates two flights behind doors open breeze no America airlines workers http://t.co/6MBK79mdnW
13884,@AmericanAir Great - thank you.
13885,@AmericanAir yes and the auto rebook confirmed an outbound that departs after the return flight.  # fire the software programmers
13886,@AmericanAir I'm getting calls from 1-800-433-7300 but the calls seem to drop instantly. Is there any alternate avenue for resched. support?
13887,@AmericanAir Supposed to arrive at my destination tonight. American rebooks me for Wednesday? Where am I staying until then?
13888,@AmericanAir @USAirways how can you have no food on a 4 hour flight 528 from Columbus to Phoenix? Starving and Pissed off. Can't eat Go Go!
13889,"@AmericanAir jal and cathay pacific so no, I can't do it online."
13890,@AmericanAir what is the status of flight 1675 tomorrow
13891,@AmericanAir 4828 but I just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now I have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. So thanks.
13892,@AmericanAir The pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened.
13893,@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
13894,@AmericanAir Hey so I'm very disappointed with my time traveling with you! I've had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed!
13895,@AmericanAir 37 minutes??????
13896,@AmericanAir  having trouble getting rebooked
13897,"@AmericanAir I understand. I'm feeling cranky. I called AA's bag tracker number and heard ""your bag has not been located."" 😩"
13898,@AmericanAir AA45 ... JFK to LAS.
13899,@AmericanAir I'm willing to hold for an agent. you aren't being helpful you keep hanging up on me #americanairsucks #hiremorepoeple
13900,"@AmericanAir I have been trying to speak with an agent the whole day about my Cancelled Flightled flight, what I can do?"
13901,@AmericanAir Need to go frm TPA to MCI tmrw &amp; my connection thru DFW is Cancelled Flightled. Can u connect me thru a diff city? Been on hold for 2 hrs
13902,@americanair Any hints to get through to and stay connected with you to rearrange weather reLate Flightd Cancelled Flights? Hours in now w/nothing.
13903,@AmericanAir no gate agent after 30 minutes to let us off the plane???? WTW / grounds crew is here / hope you're ready to cover my delay
13904,@AmericanAir You can't even get someone on the phone. Great story for the media.
13905,"“@AmericanAir:  ""Jason, you'll end up missing your connection. Please see our DFW agents for assistance.” Nope! Hasn't taken off yet, still!"
13906,@AmericanAir finally made it to chicago - 13 hours Late Flight.  Did get a $12 food voucher for my wait.about $1per/hr. Never again. Good bye.
13907,@AmericanAir instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more gate agents.
13908,@AmericanAir guys 5350 in dfw  stuck at the gate for half an hour.  Do we pull the slide or what?
13909,@AmericanAir plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
13910,@AmericanAir after all that weve been through today as a courtesy to not allow a passenger with an oxgen tank sit up there is bad business
13911,@AmericanAir Now you've Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You're losing customers. People are furious.
13912,@americanair I finally got someone on the phone so no worries!
13913,@AmericanAir it that you say is going to help us? Give me a number to call that isn't a recording w a 2 hour wait time!
13914,@AmericanAir ok. Pilots are looking for agents  - they jumped out / FLT 5350 #DFW / this is crazy
13915,@AmericanAir no you're not you're trying to book me PAST when i need 2 arrive but you're still selling seats on the day I'm trying 2 travel
13916,@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is
13917,@AmericanAir you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
13918,@AmericanAir You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We're stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days
13919,"@AmericanAir just Cancelled Flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today, then booked one in 2 days, and no customer service"
13920,"@AmericanAir Thanks - I note some, but not all, flights are Cancelled Flightled - are only some aircraft/runways working out of DFW today/tomorrow?"
13921,@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
13922,@AmericanAir we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.
13923,@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
13924,@AmericanAir i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever
13925,"@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying ""what's the hury,  the plane is not leaving"
13926,@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
13927,@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
13928,@AmericanAir Your logo looks like 3D glasses.
13929,@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
13930,@AmericanAir and let FLT 2350 know I'm coming / gate crew have yet to arrive to let us off FLT 5350 #DFW
13931,@AmericanAir you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. This has been one of the worst experiences.
13932,@AmericanAir @Expedia are killing me. Over 3 hours to get NO human to help me.
13933,@AmericanAir 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
13934,"@AmericanAir yeah, rebooked for tomorrow morning. But extremely disappointed to miss a wedding."
13935,@AmericanAir #americanview New paint scheme looks great! #usairways http://t.co/Gt6umHbh43
13936,"@AmericanAir thanks for the call on my Cancelled Flightled flight, NOT!  Flight Booking Problems me for Tues no good weather caused me 2 leave early"
13937,"@AmericanAir on plane for JFK-&gt;SFO, been sitting here for 1.5 hours waiting for push crew, how is this acceptable?"
13938,@AmericanAir waiting for you to pick up... Coming up on 3 hours now... http://t.co/nOPq5xIsbS
13939,@AmericanAir hey flight 5350 in dfw stuck at gate with no gate agent.  Plane full of people missing connections.
13940,@AmericanAir so we've now been driving across DFW for over 90mins. That's half fucking way to Texarkana! #shouldhavedriven
13941,@AmericanAir can you tell me why all flights from XNA 2 DFW are Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow morning already?
13942,@AmericanAir thank you for the update!
13943,@AmericanAir pathetic service
13944,@AmericanAir Dallas/Fort Worth flight number 5320
13945,"@AmericanAir oh it can get better apparently. After making us wait for a gate, psych!! Now we need you to de-ice before coming to the gate!!"
13946,@AmericanAir if you could get the gate crew to help us off FLT 5350 that would be great....
13947,@AmericanAir is the situation at JFK this evening is going to get better or worse ? Do not Cancelled Flight a flight like yesterday after 8h delayed
13948,@AmericanAir ya but u weren't sitting on the plane.
13949,@AmericanAir I know you can't control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted
13950,@AmericanAir I have tried to talk to someone for almost 6 hrs! you Cancelled Flightled my flight and you won't pick up the phone. pathetic &amp; very sad
13951,@AmericanAir yes. He's in the next flight
13952,@AmericanAir several hrs Late Flight and 140 characters won't do it. Cheers though
13953,"@AmericanAir my wife's flight is Cancelled Flightled, told to call. No one answers. How do we book a flight? Help us please"
13954,@AmericanAir not in any way that I am happy with or find acceptable.   If I could speak to a human maybe that would happen
13955,@AmericanAir hi my flight to DFW 2463 was Cancelled Flightled tonight. Called in and left my number for call back it's been 3hrs please help.
13956,"@AmericanAir Hi, I have my name, email, and AAdvantage #, but website won't let me reset password. Can we troubleshoot together? Thanks!"
13957,@AmericanAir Still looking as we speak.
13958,"@AmericanAir we're on AA1401 landed at 8:55pm in Miami, but waiting for a gate. Can someone on your team help us out?!"
13959,@AmericanAir - where are my bags? Baggage claim C25 or C26 (flt# 959)?? I can see the plane from here? Why does it take 25 min???
13960,"@AmericanAir is there only one call centre? I know it's busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer"
13961,@AmericanAir you guys fail again.. all I need to do is use my voucher for a ticket but I can't do it online #yourphonesystemsucks
13962,@AmericanAir Shout-out to all the ground crews working in the cold! Thanks for what y'all do. (&amp; social media team for customer service)
13963,@AmericanAir I fortunately was not on that flight - just in the same waiting area / impressed w how he handled the stressful situation
13964,"@AmericanAir we've been on hold for over 4 hrs, you Cancelled Flighted flt 2222 phl-dfw. Need assistance!!!"
13965,@AmericanAir thanks to Marie for reFlight Booking Problems me and my friends!!! I'm Cali bound thanks to this sweet angel! #blessed
13966,@AmericanAir their flights into Buffalo as well -- You were the only flight Cancelled Flightled!!!
13967,"@AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of ""weather"" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled"
13968,"@AmericanAir know that I could use that for a flight into Canada.  By they time they figured it out, it was too Late Flight to check our bags"
13969,@AmericanAir dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice.
13970,@AmericanAir its Adolfo Garcia
13971,"@AmericanAir My friend needs some help on her flt (she's not on Twiiter), can I DM you her info?"
13972,"@AmericanAir my flight from VCP to JFK was delayed and now it has been Cancelled Flighted, what should i do?"
13973,@AmericanAir hats off to Admiral Lounge attendant @ YYZ Terminal 3 who gave her banana to our toddler when none avail elsewhere.
13974,"@AmericanAir ""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous."
13975,@AmericanAir thanks. Bummer. Poor planning on my part. I assume the card in Passbook won't work either?
13976,"@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!"
13977,@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.
13978,@AmericanAir  A true #AmericanView ...The National Mall http://t.co/N7ExdbcRHg
13979,"@vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny"
13980,@AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
13981,@AmericanAir I know you are getting pummeled tonight @dfwairport we were one of the lucky out of @slcairport just one more @AUStinAirport
13982,@AmericanAir And gold status too.
13983,@AmericanAir In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can't reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do?
13984,@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
13985,@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
13986,@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
13987,"@AmericanAir I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won't be better for flight 750. thanks"
13988,@AmericanAir I'm on #1058 tmrw from CUN DFW. Final dest'n is ORD. Seeing freezing rain in DFW all morning. Should I change my connection?
13989,@AmericanAir no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg
13990,@AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines
13991,@AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
13992,@AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid
13993,@AmericanAir I'm booked for Tuesday night. 60 degrees in Alabama right now. I'm good. Stay warm and safe.
13994,@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
13995,@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
13996,@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
13997,@AmericanAir you set a schedule try and keep it !!! #AAALWAYSLate Flight
13998,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?"
13999,@AmericanAir Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help?
14000,"@AmericanAir Thanks for the reply, but a functioning plane four hours ago was the only way to do that. The staff was friendly, tho."
14001,Thank you for sending more details  @AmericanAir: They're pretty handy dandy. more info here: http://t.co/FvlxIRh1F1 #LookforwardtoflywithAA
14002,@AmericanAir aa223 being ignored
14003,"@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the ""we'll call you when someone is free"" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up."
14004,@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
14005,@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
14006,"@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time"
14007,@AmericanAir what do kids aged 11 and 12 need to fly with AA internally within the usa. Thanks for confirming
14008,@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
14009,"@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault."
14010,@AmericanAir Please help AA 2258 Monday Cancelled Flightled.  Can you advise on reFlight Booking Problems / refund.  Have children and need to make plans now
14011,@AmericanAir DM sent. Answer me please
14012,"@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane 😢😕😦 #AmericanAirlines"
14013,@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
14014,@AmericanAir I've never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline.
14015,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.
14016,@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
14017,@AmericanAir American Airlines.
14018,@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
14019,@AmericanAir the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.
14020,@AmericanAir I just DMed you
14021,@AmericanAir why is it most first class passengers now request the sand which from coach ?
14022,@AmericanAir @DAI_President Good luck at DFW this evening AA!
14023,@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
14024,"@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting"
14025,@AmericanAir Awesome customer service on #390 from rdu. They snuck my wife a warm cookie. Thx!
14026,@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food
14027,"@AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful 😳"
14028,"@americanair seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF"
14029,@AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.
14030,"@AmericanAir  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks."
14031,"@AmericanAir just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams."
14032,@AmericanAir Flight 1512 (N924AN) departs @FlyTPA enroute to @dfwairport http://t.co/j0mhMkDiVl
14033,@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
14034,"@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight."
14035,@AmericanAir checking into a flight on your website is about as easy as asking a bear to shit in a toilet #justsaying
14036,@AmericanAir makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
14037,@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
14038,@AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
14039,@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
14040,"@americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ"
14041,@AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
14042,@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293
14043,@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
14044,"@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks."
14045,@AmericanAir my #Navy sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can't get an agent. They've called her back to be put on hold &amp; then discnct.Any help?
14046,@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y’all hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
14047,@AmericanAir Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket--I can't do both. Can you help?
14048,@americanair anxious to see how you all care for customers you’ve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight
14049,"@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy."
14050,"@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick ""Goodbye"" Very Sad!"
14051,@AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!
14052,"@AmericanAir I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?"
14053,@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.
14054,@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
14055,"@AmericanAir yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though 😒 I'm really mad about the situation"
14056,"@AmericanAir whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won't stray anymore. I'm talking about you @Delta!"
14057,"@AmericanAir @praywinn between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer..."
14058,"@AmericanAir I need help with a reservation purchased on @AmericanAir but operated on @USAirways, can't get through on the 800#"
14059,@AmericanAir  flight from DFW to LIT tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled.  What do I do next?  Pls advise.  #HELP
14060,@AmericanAir how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight!
14061,@AmericanAir my flight I have reserved for tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. Can I Cancelled Flight my reservation and get a full refund?
14062,@AmericanAir thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome
14063,@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
14064,@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
14065,"@AmericanAir ""overweight"" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is."
14066,"@AmericanAir @jaynegelman How,about more@Blacklist too!!"
14067,@AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
14068,"@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled."
14069,@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....
14070,@AmericanAir I ended up on a flight to LA my fourth time on standby. Thanks! http://t.co/NA5G5EAKPA
14071,@AmericanAir been waiting on hold for more than an hour
14072,@AmericanAir thanks. Now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. Won't be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning.
14073,"@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses."
14074,@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
14075,@AmericanAir @HeyMyNameIsSEAN Sean if you look at the AA schedule it sometimes gives you a clue if new'airplanes are used. They are gr8
14076,@AmericanAir thanks for the show! 👍
14077,"@AmericanAir well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel @PHLAirport"
14078,@AmericanAir no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :)
14079,"@AmericanAir @kconti44 This looks like JFK - had a great pic of the OneWorld jets lined up on the opposite side #Air Berlin, LAN and AA."
14080,"@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!"
14081,"@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits"
14082,@AmericanAir @superyan I did hear a last call for boarding of this flight when I was at JFK a few hours ago. good luck w/flights!
14083,"@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport"
14084,@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
14085,"@AmericanAir Yo, could that be a catering truck before mine eyes?  Unmoving? http://t.co/ASW6QwUf1Z"
14086,@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
14087,@AmericanAir Great seats on this aircraft!
14088,Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one plane😡
14089,@AmericanAir Both pictures taken at the same time but which is right? #totallyconfused http://t.co/dvSLtQZKmQ
14090,@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!
14091,@AmericanAir 901 #Miami to #Rio to participate at @RCM_Oficial representing @CisnerosMedia #yourstoryhere
14092,@AmericanAir a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on!
14093,@AmericanAir @cyncyn661 Are you now flying 763s to Madrid from JFK or is this DFW/ORD? Huge !!
14094,@AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
14095,@AmericanAir who's your pick for best picture? I don't want to board your airline until I know
14096,@AmericanAir we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers
14097,"@AmericanAir @PatrichRuben no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs"
14098,@AmericanAir 8:30 departure?  Sure. Is there a catering strike at JFK?  @FoxNews @CNBC @BloombergRadio http://t.co/HPgXYZRW8o
14099,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , so what would be a file number that works , needs to be 10 characters , email me derek.austin@century21.ca  easier"
14100,"@AmericanAir @manuel_c ""here for you"" as in, yeah, we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our Twitter bot cares? Or...."
14101,@AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
14102,@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
14103,"@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got"
14104,@AmericanAir DONE!! thank you so much!!
14105,@AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs
14106,@AmericanAir then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue
14107,@AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.
14108,"@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS"
14109,"@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?"
14110,@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
14111,@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa
14112,@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
14113,@AmericanAir 740pm wheels up to be exact.  I'm sending a DM.
14114,@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
14115,@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK
14116,@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
14117,"@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!"
14118,"@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots"
14119,@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap
14120,@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
14121,@AmericanAir you wont allow calls? My husband has a ticket but it looks like all the seats are taken? I cant even call.
14122,@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
14123,@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
14124,@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
14125,@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
14126,@AmericanAir we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids
14127,@AmericanAir 3198 to AEX. Is it still going?
14128,@AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
14129,@AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?
14130,@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
14131,"@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?"
14132,@AmericanAir Close down
14133,@AmericanAir it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to DCA. Let's get another great leg too tonight!
14134,@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
14135,@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
14136,@AmericanAir I’ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
14137,@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
14138,@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
14139,@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
14140,@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
14141,@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
14142,@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
14143,@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
14144,@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
14145,@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
14146,@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
14147,@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
14148,@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
14149,@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
14150,@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
14151,@AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options?
14152,@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
14153,@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
14154,@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
14155,@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
14156,@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
14157,@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
14158,@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
14159,"@AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz."
14160,@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting
14161,@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
14162,@AmericanAir my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight
14163,@AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
14164,"@AmericanAir versus @JetBlue 
in Customer Service?
Who will win!
For Me @AmericanAir is a convenience to a trip to Cali &lt;3"
14165,"@AmericanAir agents refuse to help, ""too busy"" &amp; need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO"
14166,@AmericanAir fight got Cancelled Flighted can u help me rebook a flight?  Call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold #yuck
14167,@AmericanAir you should be contacting her for a refund - dm me and I will provide phone number
14168,@AmericanAir ah if only we could get through. We've tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call @united?
14169,@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
14170,"@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins"
14171,@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
14172,@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
14173,@AmericanAir trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.
14174,"@AmericanAir yep, they moved me to 16A as they showed me flying ""standby"""
14175,@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
14176,"@AmericanAir My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel?"
14177,@AmericanAir I'm on 1024 into Dallas. Do I have any chance of catching 2238 to Boston? Do I need to run from Gate D6 to A15?.
14178,@AmericanAir AA I need a Hail Mary. How do I get from Dallas to Joplin JLN in the next 14 hours. Willing to fly to other airports and drive
14179,@AmericanAir I've been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now. Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight and not notifying me.
14180,@AmericanAir rude gate agent by AA363 ORD-LGA just now. Seems to have a temper. Made me check in a bag that fit INSIDE the sizer.
14181,"@AmericanAir Hi ho, hi ho. It's off to work I go. #WeeklyCommuteOnAA http://t.co/JQHg4jTm4w"
14182,@AmericanAir you put a sour taste on this customer’s vacation. it was joke watching those “we care thanks for choosing us” videos
14183,@AmericanAir are you expecting flights out of DFW to be Cancelled Flightled tomorrow AM and afternoon?
14184,@AmericanAir help us here !!! We are stuck here @jfk for more than 24hours! !we need to go home #flight919 #saveus
14185,@AmericanAir lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. I'll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight I want is still there Late Flightr.
14186,@AmericanAir Flight  AA1691 LAX to LAS closes too early and gate agents give us hassles #PatheticCX
14187,@AmericanAir I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...
14188,"@AmericanAir here we go again #aa106 ""Plane not ready"". Are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night #shortstaffed"
14189,@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded
14190,@AmericanAir At what e-mail adress can I send your CEO Mr. Doug Parker a letter that he hopefully reads?
14191,"@AmericanAir why does your customer service line say ""we are experiencing high call volume"" and then spontaneously hangup on the person?"
14192,@AmericanAir well its been over 4 hours now and still no one has picked up   try paying overtime and bring in more people
14193,@AmericanAir What's the best way to check on any delays or Cancelled Flightlations for my flight out of DFW on Tuesday?
14194,@americanair @bershawnjackson big UPS to Newark airport staff &amp;&amp; D.Dean. I was also treated lovely while I was in town. ❤❤
14195,@AmericanAir pleaseeee find my suitcase. I want deoderant and a clean shirt for work tomorrow :(
14196,@AmericanAir Here you go https://t.co/oM1vIEg74a
14197,"@AmericanAir Hey, so... I think I left my wallet on you. Can I have it back, please?"
14198,"@AmericanAir ok, thanks you! Have a great night AA team!"
14199,@AmericanAir - Can you please give me a travel agent support phone number? I cant find it on your website. Thanks.

14203,@AmericanAir  You can't get us to Cincy but our luggage will still go there tonight? Stranded us in Dallas for 2 days w/o clothes? #Yousuck
14204,@AmericanAir It just hangs up and your agents on the ground are useless. How don't I have a seat on a first class ticket booked weeks ago?
14205,@AmericanAir ive literally been holding for more than 2 HOURS now. i was told 2hrs. You all are sabotaging any chance i have of getting home
14206,@AmericanAir we're still here guys - you are the worst
14207,@AmericanAir 24 hours on the AirPort
14208,@AmericanAir - don't understand why I have zero Flt info- no email- 2 he wait time on ph lines- so much for Advan Mem :(
14209,@AmericanAir ok so why is it Late Flight? And for that matter why was my flight 4491 Cancelled Flighted this morning? I've been in YYZ since 5 AM.

14216,@AmericanAir Flight's Cancelled Flightled. Website says to call phone number.Phone says to check online.  How am I supposed to get some help?
14217,@AmericanAir yes. We spent the whole day talking to agents and someone finally offered to let him stay in a hotel
14218,@AmericanAir flight from JFK to EGE was cxld after on runway for an hour. Flight moved to 7am but they won't give luggage back. Nice.
14219,@AmericanAir delayed for two hours at ORD--&gt;CDG the one time I need to be there to catch a train... 😒

14221,@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted our flight and now are still delayed...NOT COOL.
14222,@AmericanAir we did for the last 8 hours.  Your customer service is horrendous.  I should have flown Delta
14223,@AmericanAir there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay
14224,@AmericanAir why a different airport! I have no way of getting to a different airport.
14225,"@AmericanAir AA agent said I repeated myself when I was explaining. I told him ""I understand English."" His reply?""Our conversation is over."""
14226,"@AmericanAir long wait? I literally went shopping at 3 different centers, had lunch and prepared dinner. surprise, it's winter! staff better"

14228,@AmericanAir is flight 2934 dfw to gsp going to be Cancelled Flightled tomorrow?
14229,@AmericanAir Stuck on the plane in Charlotte.  Going to miss my connection.  No words from staff. Maybe some damn pretzels?

14240,@AmericanAir Considering it was purchased on the 21st and I attempted to use it again on the 21st I believe it would fit these parameters.
14241,"@AmericanAir pretty impressed with the in flight entertainment. Full touch, usable, smooth, good selection."
14242,@AmericanAir Now your site is not working! WTF
14243,"@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue can you help? @SpiritAirlines is in the wrong, stuck in Florida 3days. They need to learn from real airlines."

14245,@AmericanAir I'm great thanks keep up the good work
14246,@AmericanAir my flight has been delayed &amp; I can't talk reach anyone in customer service because of high call volume.

14278,@AmericanAir Thank you. Good suggestion. I checked and we were not rebooked. We'll keep checking and looking for other flights

14302,@AmericanAir our flight was Cancelled Flightled and rebooked to United. You didn't give them accurate ticket number now we can't check in. #annoyed
14303,@AmericanAir You guys are totally losing me. I've been an AA fan for years but telling me reps are busy and hanging up on me is really bad.

14306,@AmericanAir it's always better to find out equipment is INOP on the ground than in the air! #safetyfirst
14307,@AmericanAir is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head

14313,"@AmericanAir @SeguineJ AA - this is a joke, right? That line isn't even accepting calls right now - they just hang up."
14314,"@AmericanAir yes, and rebooked incorrectly."
14315,"@AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me"
14316,@AmericanAir even with calls you haven't been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome
14317,@AmericanAir 2293 is the Cancelled Flightled one

14321,"@AmericanAir while I'm sensitive to this fact, I don't believe that warrants poor service. A little help &amp; compassion goes a long way."
14322,@AmericanAir Flight attendant #YeseniaHernandez provided excellent service among peculiar conditions throughout the day ✈ :-)
14323,@AmericanAir I did. 5 times. With 4 of those being hung up on. The other one it finally sent me to the call back notification. #FixYourStuff
14324,"@AmericanAir complt incompetence on flt 295.Lav delay from a pln that lnded last nite, no internet and poor svc. Not what I expect from u."

14326,@AmericanAir why would I bother wasting my time calling them when they are gunna do nothing
14327,@AmericanAir five times at last count
14328,@AmericanAir as usual my next flight shows on time but it's suppose to leave in 5 minutes and hasn't boarded

14337,@AmericanAir @SentieriMelinda Any updates? It shouldn't take hours for assistance. I love @SouthwestAir
14338,@AmericanAir I've flown you many years without a complaint. You should start listening to your customers.  You went from first to worst
14339,@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled 2 of my flights for maintenance. Customer service desk is empty... Can I get a hotel at least? http://t.co/ypbkCiRBXu

14349,@AmericanAir she should not only get a refund but also an apology for the deplorable service.

14519,"@AmericanAir because of you, I am doing the one thing I tried to avoid. Thank you for sending me to baggage claim."
14520,@AmericanAir my flt is at 7a tom. I have now rec'd notification that I'm going out from some other airport
14521,@AmericanAir how does one book a ticket online and put it on hold?  Does that require that I pay for the ticket?
14522,@AmericanAir can you help me with a reservation? cant get through on the phone
14523,@AmericanAir ask the 10 people you left behind at Miami airport because you guys could not wait 5 minutes and ... http://t.co/XPM98Igqjn
14524,"@AmericanAir can you do anything to get #AA953 moving? Been almost 24 hrs and hundreds at jfk upset, tired and want to get to BA."
14525,@AmericanAir more of the insane treatment by your customers
14526,@americanair Help!  I need to speak to a live agent before I lose my online reservation being held.
14527,"@AmericanAir @_emmaclifford No. At JFK you sort of have to guess things out. It's a small airport, so whatever."
14528,@AmericanAir is this how you let your employees treat your loyal customers? #attackingbabymomma #crazinessintherockies
14529,@AmericanAir  Mad love http://t.co/4ojrSDWPkK NYC-
14530,"@AmericanAir thanks for forcing me to check -in my carry - on luggage. That is exactly why I spent extra money on ""travel size"" toiletries"
14531,"@AmericanAir @ejacqui If you updated the screens, then people would know the Late Flightst info, good or bad. And that wouldn't work because..."
14532,@AmericanAir missing a full days of work thanks guys
14533,@AmericanAir Trying to find out if flight #340 DFW to HOU is on tonight. Exec platinum desk not calling back and online info not clear.
14534,.@AmericanAir I can't even get on the phone with your reservations team. The system automatically disconnects us.
14535,@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flighted and rebooked but agent made a mistake and booked wrong date! Been trying to get through via phone for hours!!
14536,"@AmericanAir @russelneiss No, American. This is simple. How about YOU call HER back with the info for her new flight. Basic customer service"
14537,@AmericanAir I have looked and I was told it was in Guatemala last night. No record of anywhere today. I need my clothing for work tomorrow.
14538,"@AmericanAir Cool, a canned response. Nah, I think I'll keep tweeting at everyone who mentions AA on Twitter. You could DM me, though."
14539,@AmericanAir please fix your mobile and desktop site to allow Canadians to select a passenger when checking in. Thanks.
14540,@AmericanAir tried ringing but told me to try again Late Flightr. I'm supposed to be leaving in an hour...

14542,.@AmericanAir cover a rental car or refund our ticket? - I'll gladly drive 10 hrs home than be stuck here till Tues!
14543,@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
14544,@AmericanAir   You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
14545,@AmericanAir yes and I would like a refund.
14546,@AmericanAir how realistic is it to make an 80 minute domestic to international transfer at JFK for a non US citizen?
14547,Eliza &amp; I cheated on u @AmericanAir with @AirTahitiNui &amp; it was a lovely flight. But we'll be back! Lots!

14549,"@AmericanAir @sweetmel If weather is bad, wouldn't your folks try extra hard to communicate...or load bags onto flight 1320...or...anything?"
14550,"@AmericanAir and how is this not a mechanical issue? All evidence points to the idea that it’s the ILS at CLL at fault, not the weather."
14551,"@AmericanAir @CAexhibitions Sorry in, like, a general way? Or sorry that incompetence/understaffing is compounding weather issues?"
14552,@AmericanAir please help us get home tomorrow!!!!!
14553,"@AmericanAir @tennetexan Too bad there's only, like, 3 people on that team, then. Because this is next level unreal."
14554,"@AmericanAir @marxsterbcow How is this a real life response to a customer service issue? Seriously. Keep trying to call us. Eh, might work."

14574,@AmericanAir I DMed you my AA &amp; phone #s &amp; you can't have someone call me? What was the point of your response? You didn't resolve anything!

14586,".@AmericanAir nice 2 know. I paid 4 a seat. Then you sold my seat. now I bought a 3rd seat. It's a good scam, but a scam all the same."
